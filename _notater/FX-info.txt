There can only be one controller per FXML-file

single responsibility


and it should be declared in the top level element. 
I made two FXML's, one that represents the main screen and one that acts as the 
menu bar. 
You probably want a division of your logic in multiple controllers, 
rather then stuffing to much in a single controller – 
single responsibility is a good design guideline
